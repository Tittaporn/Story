Almost the end !!
# What wil I do?
The padamic is here in 2020. The whole year in the U.S. with being locking down made me rethink about my future. I started learning more how to code. I love the feeling of debuging something and finally fixing the bug on my code. It is something small I can be happy with it. Every life has the end point, but before the last day of my life. I would like to do something small to change this world. Coding is my passion that I believed I could do it everyday. Nowadays, I may only do build some easy app and learn some swift. I may just spending all day to figure ou how tableView work. I may only learn how to use MVC on my project. I storgly believed that innovation in this world start off small steps. The future is ahead of me, but I have set my path to be an iOS developer. I am now learning using Xcode, Swift and iOS development from Udemy, Udacity. In 2020, I already signed up for DevMountian Class. I am ready to work hard to be an iOS developer. **To continue following me on my Github. My coding journey.**
