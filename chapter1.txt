#Where am I from?
It was a time I was born in south of Thailand. My home town called "Padangbazar." _ปาดังเบซาร์_ is a border between Thailand and Malaysia. I loved the sun and beaches where I enjoyed growing up in the land of smile. The happiness of my chilhood was just a few moment ago. Time files, I was in โรงเรียนวรนารีเฉลิม จังหวัดสงขลา. It was my high school, I took English-Chinese Program. Yes, I know a little bit Chinese. Yes, I only knew a bit English at that time. High school years were happy ending, then I was ended up at Chulalongkorn University to learn to be a teacher. My major were Non-Formal Education and Counseling Psychology and Guidance. My college years was incredible. I learned, played, worked and enjoyed life. I missed those time, friends and people. I finally got the degree, however I knew I would never ever stop learning. `To continue on Chapter2`
