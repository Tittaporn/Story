# Why am I here?
If you read chapter 1, you know I am from Thailand, the paradise of the world. However. I left my beautiful country because I know there is many things in this world I need to learn and to see. After I finished school in Bangkok, I would like to improve my English skills that I had a little bit from whole 22 years of Education in the country that people don't speak English. Therefore, I decided to put myself in the country that people speak English. I came here in Chicago, USA in 2013. It was the best exciting decision I have made in my life. It was my turning point. I did not even speak English or could not speak with everyone in the first few months. It was days over day, months over months and years over years. I finally can say that I can speak English. I am happy that I achieved my goal of being able to communicate with more people in this world. My world is much bigger. My learning experiences are more wide open. Those years I have struggle tried to learn cultures and languages, it also made me realize that I will success in everything set plan on. The next language I would like to master is programing languages. `That is why I am here to code.`
