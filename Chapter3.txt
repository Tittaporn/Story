# What have I done?
Dreamweaver was the first app I tried to build an website for my mom when I was in high school. I bought a book, follow steps on the book. I tried to buy domain name. I did ever know everyone who could guide me on building website. I was almost successful on it. I always have passion on computer. I can spend my life doing things on computer all day long. I think computer and technology are very interesting skill trades for me. I was studying to be a teacher, but I always helped my roomates to install software and applications. It was always fun trying to figure it out what is going on the computer. When I arrived in the U.S. I started from studying ESL_(English for Second Language.)_ I later applied to Chicago Community College. I learned Java, C#, C++, Web development, Andriod Studio and so on. I graduated in Associate Degree in Computer Information Systems in 2018. It was really my first step to the tech industy. I have never stop learning. I signed up on Udemy where I learned a lot more anout web development, andriod development and iOS development. I realize I am really into iOS development. `I may pray for the next chapter of my life is being an iOS developer`
